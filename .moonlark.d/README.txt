Moonlark will automatically add `<rootdir>/.moonlark.d/` (where
<rootdir> is the project root directory) to the Moonlark load path.

In the Sealark repo, this directory and this file are under version
control for documentation purposes. But other contents are gitignored,
so it can be used to test Scheme code during Sealark development. Do
not check in any other files in this directory.
